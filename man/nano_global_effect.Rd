\usage{
nano_global_effect(
  nano,
  model_no = nano$n_model,
  vars,
  max_levels = 30,
  method = "ale",
  quantiles = seq(0, 1, 0.1),

}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{a list of character strings. Elements are variables to calculate global effects
of. For "ale" and "pdp" method, able to calculate two-way variable interaction global effect.
To specify two-way interaction, enter pair of variables as a vector in the list. For example:
list(v1, c(v2, v3), v4) will calculate the global effects for v1 and v4, and then the
two-way effect of v2 and v3.}

\item{max_levels}{a numeric. Maximum number of unique levels to calculate pdp for each
variable.}

\item{method}{a character. Takes the value "ale", "pdp" or "ice".}

\item{quantiles}{a numeric vector of quantiles (numbers from 0 to 1) for each ICE to be
calculated for. Only valid when \code{method = "ice"}.}

\item{models}{a list of h2o model.}

\item{data}{a list of dataseta. If the underlying dataset is the same for each model, can
only input a list with a single element.}
}
\value{
a list of data.tables containing values for each variable combined together and each
element corresponds to a separate model.
}
\description{
Creates ALEs, PDPs and ICEs for variable(s) for multiple h2o models.
}
\details{
The "ale" and "pdp" method is implement using the \code{iml} package. The main
advantage of the \code{iml} package is that it is extremely robust and has one of the
fastest algorithmns for computing global effects. Further, it is one of the few
packages while is able to calculate two-way variable interactions for ALEs and PDPs.
For more details, see \code{iml::FeatureEffect}.

The "ice" method is implemented by using h2o's built in \code{h2o.ice} function. The reason
why this is preferred over iml's implementation is that \code{h2o.ice} allows flexibility
for which rows to calculate the ICE for. In the \code{iml} package, the ICE is calculated
for all rows which can become computationally intensive for large dataset. For more
details, see \code{h2o::h2o.ice}.

When modelling using the \code{nano} package, it is recommended to instead use the
\code{nano_global_effect} function. This is a wrapper for a series of functions which
calculates global effects. It is able to calculate the global effects directly from a
nano object, for both single and multiple models, and has the option to return various plots.
