The goal of `nano` is to streamline the entire modelling process from the data preparation stage to model to running model diagnostics. Functions are user-friendly with minimal arguments to ensure ease of use, while remaining flexible. The main power of `nano` is that it allows all models to built in a single object to avoid cluttering of the environment and make it easy to track different models. As well, the advantage compared to other packages is that `nano` allows different model types to be easily compared. This helps simplify the model selection process and ensure the best model is selected.
